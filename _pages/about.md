About Me
--------

Hi, I am Harsh Sanjay Roniyar. I am currently a first year under-graduate student at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/)

A data-driven personal website
==============================



Getting started
===============



Site-wide configuration
-----------------------



Create content & metadata
-------------------------



**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
